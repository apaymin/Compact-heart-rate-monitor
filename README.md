# Compact Heart Rate Monitor

This is my term project. The task was to made PCB and full documentation set from given schematic diagram and article.

Device is compact heart rate monitor based on schematic diagram from [article](http://archive.radio.ru/web/1994/08/031/) published in "Радио" ("Radio") magazine (№8, 1994, pp. 31-32). All parts are Russian and can be bought now.

## Device

This monitor measures heart rate by counting filtered and amplified R-wave (from QRS-complex) from cardiogram, sensed by copper pads.
User should hold device with both hands and place thumbs of each hend on copper pads.

More information about inner working could be found in report or original article (both in Russian).

## PCB Project

PCB was made in Altium Designer.  
Most of the documentation (except BOM) was made using Draftsman add-on for Altium. Not all of them exactly follow **current** GOSTs or other standarts due to the teacher requirements.
